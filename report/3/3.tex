    \item \textcolor{blue}{(1)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textcolor{blue}{Using the utility function you have specified, estimate the utility of policies on the historical data.}
            \item \textcolor{blue}{Measure the utility of the historical policy on the historical data.}
            \item \textcolor{blue}{Provide error bounds on the expected utility and explain how those were obtained.}
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{(2)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textcolor{blue}{Find an improved policy, and calculate the expected utility of the improved policy on the historical data.}
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{(3)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textcolor{blue}{Obtain an estimate of the historical policy.}
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{(4)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textcolor{blue}{Simulate the historical policy and your improved policy on the obtained simulator.}
